UDP Echo Client/Server (Remote Procedure Calls)
A simple client/server pair built with raw Java sockets (java.net.DatagramSocket)
demonstrating UDP communication — no external networking libraries used.
What it does
The client sends a text message to the server.
The server:
Prints the client's IP address and port to the console.
Inverts the case of every letter in the message (Hello → hELLO).
Sends the inverted message back.
The client prints the reply.
This project corresponds to the course topic Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) —
demonstrating the fundamental request/response pattern that RPC frameworks
build on top of, implemented here at the raw socket level.
Why UDP
UDP (DatagramSocket/DatagramPacket) is connectionless — there's no handshake
before sending data, unlike TCP. This makes it simple and fast, at the cost of
no delivery guarantee. It's well suited to a simple request/reply exchange like
this one.
How to run
1. Compile both files:
javac EchoServer.java EchoClient.java
2. Start the server (in one terminal):
java EchoServer
3. Start the client (in a separate terminal):
java EchoClient
4. Type messages in the client. Type exit to quit.
Example
You: Hello
Server: hELLO

client: Goodbye World
Server: gOODBYE wORLD

Server console output:
Received from 127.0.0.1:39722 -> "Hello"
Replied with -> "hELLO"
Received from 127.0.0.1:39722 -> "Goodbye World"
Replied with -> "gOODBYE wORLD"


Key concepts demonstrated
Raw socket programming: DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket, no
networking libraries or frameworks.
Connectionless communication: each packet is independent; the server
doesn't maintain a persistent connection to the client.
Byte-level data transfer: strings are converted to/from raw bytes
(getBytes() / new String(...)) — the network only understands bytes,
not Java objects, so this conversion is required for any data to travel
over a socket.
Client identification: UDP packets carry the sender's address and port
automatically, which the server reads via getAddress() and getPort().
